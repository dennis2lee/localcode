# Changelog

## v0.9.0

- Token usage tracking: all three providers (Bedrock, Anthropic direct, OpenAI-compat) now report input/output token usage per turn (`provider.EventUsage`), surfaced as a new `usage` session event with context-window fill percentage (via a new `internal/modelinfo` best-effort max-context lookup) and tokens-per-second.
- Auto-compaction: once a session's context usage crosses 80%, the conversation history is summarized by the model in place and replaced with the summary before the next turn — toggle with `config.json`'s `auto_compact_enabled` or live via `/config auto_compact on|off`. A new `compacted` event marks when it happens.
- `/config` command: view or toggle `auto_compact` and `show_tps` (tokens-per-second display) live, process-wide, without restarting; `GET /api/settings` reports current values for clients that just connected.
- Session rename (`Session.Title`, `Store.SetTitle`, `POST /api/sessions/{id}/rename`) and delete (`Store.Delete`, `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}`, refuses while a turn is in-flight) — both exposed as buttons in the Web UI's session list.
- `mcp.Manager.Servers()` + `GET /api/mcp-servers`: lists currently-connected MCP server names, shown in the Web UI's right panel.
- File uploads (`POST /api/sessions/{id}/uploads`) for the Web UI's new drag-and-drop attachment support — saves to `~/.localcode/uploads/<session-id>/<filename>` and inserts a path reference into the prompt for the model to read with its own file tools.
- Web UI: persistent right-panel session list (switch/rename/delete) replacing the old modal picker, a connected-MCP-servers list below it, drag-and-drop file attachment on the prompt box, and a status line under the prompt showing current agent/model, context-window fill %, TPS, and a pulsing "communicating" indicator that flashes on completion.

## v0.8.0

- Fine-grained permission rules (opencode-style): `config.json`'s new `permission` field maps a tool name (or `"*"` fallback) to either a flat `"allow"/"ask"/"deny"` or an ordered array of `{"match": glob, "decision": ...}` rules matched against the call's subject (the bash command string, or a file path for `write_file`/`edit`) — last match wins. Lets safe commands (`git *`) run without a prompt while dangerous ones (`rm *`) are blocked outright, and can even restrict tools that previously never asked (e.g. deny reading `*.env`). No `permission` config at all preserves exactly today's behavior.

## v0.7.0

- `localcode login bedrock`: native AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) device-authorization flow — no AWS CLI required. Writes the same artifacts the AWS CLI does (`~/.aws/sso/cache/<sha1(start-url)>.json`, a `[profile ...]` block in `~/.aws/config`), so the default AWS credential chain (which `provider.Bedrock` already relies on) picks it up automatically. `config.json`'s `providers.<name>.profile` selects the named profile.
- `localcode login anthropic`: saves a personal Anthropic API key (from console.anthropic.com) to `~/.localcode/credentials.json` (mode 0600), and a new `anthropic` provider type talks directly to `api.anthropic.com` — usage-billed separately from a claude.ai Pro/Max subscription, not a substitute for one. Unlocks the newest Claude models (Opus 4.7/4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5) that Bedrock's Converse API doesn't yet expose.
- Explicitly does **not** implement reusing a claude.ai Pro/Max subscription itself (what Claude Code's own login does) — that requires Anthropic's undocumented, Claude-Code-only OAuth client, and reimplementing it in a third-party tool would risk violating Anthropic's terms of service.

## v0.6.1

- Fix: custom-command expansion no longer re-scans substituted content for further directives — a `!`shell`` command's output or an argument value containing an `@path` (e.g. `@/etc/passwd`) is now left literal instead of being read and inlined. Expansion is a single left-to-right pass; `$1`/`$ARGUMENTS` still substitute into the shell command itself.
- Fix: auto-memory `MEMORY.md` index no longer emits invalid UTF-8 when the 25KB byte cap lands in the middle of a multi-byte rune (CJK/emoji); the incomplete trailing bytes are trimmed.

## v0.6.0

- Claude Code-style auto memory: model-written notes persisted across sessions under `~/.localcode/projects/<slug>/memory/` (slug derived from the git repo root, shared across worktrees), with `MEMORY.md` as the index (loaded into the system prompt every session, capped at 200 lines/25KB matching Claude Code's own limit) and topic files read on demand via the model's existing file tools — no dedicated Memory tool needed. Toggle with `"auto_memory_enabled": false` in config.json (default on). `/memory` local command shows the directory and current index.
- `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` rules files now support Claude Code's `@path/to/import` syntax: recursive imports up to 4 hops, relative paths resolved against the importing file's directory, `~/` for home-relative, references inside fenced code blocks or inline code spans left literal.

## v0.5.0

- Multi-agent Task delegation: `AgentConfig` gains `description`/`prompt`/`tools`, per-agent tool scoping enforced in both the specs the model sees and at call time, `Task` tool (registered once 2+ agents are configured) for synchronous delegation with a depth guard against infinite recursion
- Plan mode: mid-conversation agent switching (`Store.SetAgent`, `agent.switched` event, `GET /api/agents`, `POST /api/sessions/{id}/agent`) — TUI Tab-key cycling + `/agent` command, Web UI header dropdown + `/agent` command
- AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md project + global rules files, auto-loaded into the system prompt (opencode/Claude Code convention) — project file found by climbing from cwd to the git root, global file at `~/.localcode/AGENTS.md` (falls back to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), both included when present
- `/init` command: scans the repo and has the model generate or improve `AGENTS.md`
- Custom slash commands: `.localcode/commands/*.md` (project) and `~/.localcode/commands/*.md` (global), with YAML frontmatter (`description`/`agent`/`model`) and template expansion (`$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`-`$9`, `` !`shell` ``, `@file`); `GET /api/commands` + `/commands` local listing in TUI/Web UI

## v0.4.0

- `-version`/`--version` inline flag (alongside the existing `localcode version` subcommand)
- Prompt input auto-grows as the message gets longer (TUI: `bubbles/textarea`, Enter to send / Ctrl+J for newline; Web UI: `<textarea>` with JS auto-resize, Shift+Enter for newline)
- `/skill` slash command: `/skill` lists registered skills with no model call, `/skill <name>` splices that skill's body into the model's turn immediately
- `/help`, `/version`, `exit`/`:q` local commands in both TUI and Web UI (handled client-side; `/version` reports the attached daemon's build version via `GET /api/version`)
- [MODELS.md](MODELS.md): verified Bedrock/Claude model IDs and setup steps, plus local-LLM (LM Studio/vLLM) setup — flags that the newest Claude models (Opus 4.7/4.8, Sonnet 5, Fable 5) aren't reachable through this project's Bedrock provider yet
- Broader unit test coverage (Bedrock/OpenAI-compat translation functions, built-in tools, config validation, session store) so the implementation can be self-verified without a real Bedrock or local-LLM connection

## v0.3.0

- Session list/resume: `GET /api/sessions`, TUI startup picker, Web UI session-switch modal
- `message.user` event so a resumed session replays the user's own prompts, not just the model's answers
- MCP server connection failures are non-fatal (one bad server no longer blocks daemon startup) and a dropped session reconnects automatically on the next call
- Expanded unit test coverage across the daemon, MCP client, and agent packages

## v0.2.0

- Core daemon: HTTP + SSE API over `agent.Loop`, with the TUI rewritten as a client of it
- Web UI served by the daemon (same HTTP/SSE API as the TUI)
- MCP client integration (stdio servers, `mcp__<server>__<tool>` namespacing, permission-gated)
- Skills (progressive disclosure via SKILL.md + the `Skill` tool)
- Background Task Manager (concurrent sub-agents, `task.spawned`/`task.status` events)

## v0.1.0

- Initial MVP: Bedrock + OpenAI-compat providers, built-in tools (read/write/edit/bash/glob/grep), Bubble Tea TUI, macOS/Windows packaging
